# Block-Youtube-Anti-Ad-Block

Youtube has done it again, by creating an annoying, avoidable pop-up, if you try using their website with an Ad-Blocking extension enabled.

![example](https://github.com/olsen-adam/Block-Youtube-Anti-Ad-Block/assets/67761974/873e3622-e622-41d7-8c50-c8ab1649b528)

This extension simply disables this popup from ever occurring. 

Please write an honest review and share it with your friends who also hate ads and annoying popups.
